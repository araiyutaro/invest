# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 14-report-ui (plan 01, if run in parallel wave)
    provides: escapeHtml / report-utils.ts shared style + escaping conventions
provides:
  - "renderSectorBarChart(sectors) — pure (data) => SVG-string horizontal bar chart, sorted descending, green/red coloring"
  - "renderVixLineChart(history) — pure (data) => SVG-string line chart with 20/30 dashed threshold reference lines"
  - "SectorDatum / VixDatum exported interfaces for downstream consumers"
  - "Fixed データ取得エラー empty-state markup for both charts"
affects: [14-report-ui plan 03 (splices these renderers into generateDailyReportHtml)]

# Phase 14 Plan 02: Inline SVG Chart Module Summary

**Pure `renderSectorBarChart` + `renderVixLineChart` SVG-string generators (no external chart library) with TDD RED/GREEN per function, matching the codebase's existing `formatXxxHtml` convention.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-01T02:24:00Z (approx, base plan commit)
- **Completed:** 2026-07-01T02:33:41Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 2 (both new)

## Accomplishments
- `renderSectorBarChart`: horizontal bar chart, sorted descending by `changePercent`, `#10b981`/`#ef4444` coloring, viewBox + `width:100%` responsive root, empty-state error copy
- `renderVixLineChart`: line chart with `#3b82f6` polyline/dots, dashed `#6b7280` threshold lines at y=20/y=30 with numeric labels, viewBox `0 0 600 200`, empty-state error copy
- Both functions escape all interpolated strings (sector names, dates) via `report-utils.ts::escapeHtml` (threat T-14-03 mitigation)
- Both functions guard `length === 0` before any SVG-coordinate math, preventing NaN coordinates on empty/partial data (threat T-14-04 mitigation)
- 8/8 unit tests green covering sort order, colors, empty state, viewBox/width contract, and HTML-escaping

## Task Commits

Each task followed TDD RED -> GREEN:

1. **Task 1: renderSectorBarChart** -
   - `03bd1da` (test) — failing test asserting sort order, colors, empty-state, viewBox, escaping
   - `295f819` (feat) — pure SVG-string implementation; all 4 sector tests green
2. **Task 2: renderVixLineChart** -
   - `eca6e26` (test) — failing test asserting polyline/dots/threshold lines, empty-state, viewBox, escaping
   - `143b176` (feat) — pure SVG-string implementation; all 8 report-charts tests green

**Plan metadata:** committed with this SUMMARY.md (see final commit in this plan's log)

## TDD Gate Compliance

Both tasks completed the full RED → GREEN cycle:
- Task 1: `test(14-02)` at `03bd1da` (RED, confirmed failing — module not found) → `feat(14-02)` at `295f819` (GREEN, confirmed passing)
- Task 2: `test(14-02)` at `eca6e26` (RED, confirmed failing — function not exported) → `feat(14-02)` at `143b176` (GREEN, confirmed passing)

No REFACTOR commits were needed — both implementations matched the RESEARCH.md reference code with no cleanup required.

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/scripts/report-charts.ts` - New module: `SectorDatum`/`VixDatum` interfaces + `renderSectorBarChart`/`renderVixLineChart` pure SVG-string functions
- `src/scripts/report-charts.test.ts` - Unit tests: 4 sector-chart cases + 4 VIX-chart cases (8 total), all green

## Decisions Made
- Reused the exact SVG math from 14-RESEARCH.md Pattern 1 (already verified against the UI-SPEC contract) rather than re-deriving bar/line layout independently — reduces risk of drift from the approved design contract.
- Kept both render functions in a single file (`report-charts.ts`) rather than splitting into two files, matching the plan's `files_modified` scope and the existing convention of grouping related pure-HTML-generator functions together (e.g. `generate-daily-report.ts` holds multiple `formatXxxHtml` functions).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Both tasks' `<action>` and `<acceptance_criteria>` were implemented verbatim from 14-RESEARCH.md Pattern 1's reference code.

## Issues Encountered

None specific to this plan's scope. One pre-existing, unrelated test failure was discovered while running the full suite (`npm test`) as a sanity check:
- `src/scripts/validate-meeting.test.ts` > `portfolioAnalysisSchema` > `decision must be one of 保持/買増/一部売却/全売却` fails on the pre-plan baseline (confirmed via `git log --oneline -1 -- src/scripts/validate-meeting.test.ts` showing last touch in an unrelated Phase 07 commit, `17f2158`). Out of scope per the Scope Boundary rule — logged to `.planning/phases/14-report-ui/deferred-items.md`, not fixed.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. No new dependencies added.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `renderSectorBarChart` and `renderVixLineChart` are ready for Plan 03 to import and splice into `generateDailyReportHtml` (per 14-RESEARCH.md's data-plumbing-gap finding: Plan 03 must load `tmp/market.json` and thread `{ sectors, vixHistory }` through as a 4th parameter).
- Both functions already handle the "fewer than 11 sectors" / "empty vixHistory" partial-data cases identified in 14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4 — no additional defensive coding needed downstream.
- No blockers.
